# Identifying COVID-19 with X-ray images

Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database).

The goal is to explore the COVID-19 Radiography dataset, created by a team of researchers from Qatar, Bangladesh and some collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia. The COVID-19 Radiography dataset contains several chest X-ray images for **COVID-19** positive cases along with **Normal** and **Viral Pneumonia** images.

The dataset has 219 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneumonia images.

See the [Jupyter Notebook]() for data preprocessing steps, issues encountered, a model creation and testing predictions and metrics to determine model accuracy.
