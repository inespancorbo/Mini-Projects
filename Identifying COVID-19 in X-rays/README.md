# aIdentifying COVID-19


explore the COVID-19 Radiography dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database - such recopilation has been created by a team of researchers from Qatar, Bangladesh and some collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia. Essentially it contains several chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images.

In the dataset there are 219 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneumonia images.

This notebook will go through all the steps for data preprocessing, all the issues encountered about it, a model creation and finally some testing predictions to determine how accurate our model is.
