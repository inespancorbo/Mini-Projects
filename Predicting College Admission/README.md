# Predicting College Admission 🎓 

The goal is to predict the “Chance of Admit” based on the different parameters that are provided in the dataset.
We will achieve this goal by using a Linear Regression model, a Neural Network, and a Decision Tree/Random Forest.

This project is part of the Graduate Admission competition held on Kaggle. The dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle website.
