# Predicting House Prices in California with Keras 🏠 🌊☀️ 

The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

Although may not help with predicting current housing prices (like Zillow ZEstimate), it is definitely fun to play with! 

This data was initially featured in the following paper:

Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions." Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.

This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from:
