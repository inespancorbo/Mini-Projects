# Clustering Geolocation Data

Here we use a real life taxi rank location data-set of the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. We try to pinpoint the locations to build service centers to accommodate as many taxis as possible with the help of clustering 🚕🗺️📍.

*Note: Taxi Rank - a place where taxis park while awaiting customers.*
