# Predicting Employee Turnover with Decision Trees and Random Forests 💼👩‍💼📈

Use Python and scikit-learn to grow decision trees and random forests, and apply them to an important business problem: Employee Turnover. Interpret decision trees and random forest models using feature importance plots. Leverage Jupyter widgets to build interactive controls to allow users to change the hyperparameters of the models on the fly with graphical controls, and see the results in real time.
